Question :- Why can't we create S3 bucket in terraform code ? Why we need to manually create it or by using the script ?
Solution :- That will not work beacuse before any resources gets created in terraform, first it has to go and check the statefile. To do that the bucket must exists. 
In real time scenario, we need to create the buckets prior, or probably you can have a shell/python script for the creation. Where it will first make sure
the bucket is created and then run the terraform apply or terraform plan.

Question :- What will happen if anyone manually login to the AWS console and terminate the resources ? How would terraform behave ?
Solution :- It will again create the resource. A refresh will be made before apply, therefore terraform will detect the VM is missing, and will update state accordingly. 
Then, it will create a new one to match configuration.
